## Processing and Analysis of Data



### Array-like Operations

In `yt`, a newly-constructed data selector contains no data -- this enables data selectors for large regions, in extremely large datasets, to be lightweight and cheap to construct.
By ensuring that these objects don't immediately consume resources, they can be manipulated and operated on in a high-level fashion, without taxing the computational power.
While these data objects *can* return the full set of data they include, `yt` also provides array-like operations that do not require immediate access to the full set of numerical values, and which align with the mental-model for data processing that `yt` exposes.
As an example, consider the following two operations:

```python
dd = ds.all_data()
dd["gas", "density"].max()
```

and

```python
dd = ds.all_data()
dd.max(("gas", "density"))
```

Both are available in `yt`.
As a side-effect of Python's object model, the first will access the `("gas", "density")` item in the object `dd`, itself a concatenated numpy array, and then execute the `max` method on it.
The second will call the `max` method on the data object, supplying to it the name of the field.
This allows `yt` to decide how to decompose, parallelize and process the data in a memory-efficient way, and spread across multiple processors.
Additionally, by emphasizing that the "maximum" is being taken on the data object, rather than the numerical data, other operations can be exposed that build on the underlying data organization.
For instance, taking the maximum along a given (spatial) axis:

```python
sp = ds.sphere("center", (10.0, "m"))
sp.max(("gas", "temperature"), axis="z")
```

This translates our meaning -- find the maximum value along the z-axis -- into a dimensionality reduction operation that uses `yt`'s built-in "projection" method.
