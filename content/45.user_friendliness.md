## User-Friendliness

Several different entrypoints exist for research codes.
For instance, an ontology of "end-users" in science has developed that emphasizes that typically "library" codes are only used implicitly by researchers.
In this framing, library codes primarily interface with application codes, rather than with researchers.
We have taken a slightly different approach with the design and development of yt, as it exists in a middle-ground as a library used *as an application* within the scripting language python and also as a library for more complex analysis of data.
