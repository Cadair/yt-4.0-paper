## Visualization and Volume Rendering {#sec:vr}

The primary method by which researchers interact with their data in `yt` is via visualization; from the standpoint of the library, however, this is a side-effect of the various analysis, regularization and data-processing algorithms that are implemented within `yt`.
Nearly all of the visualization that is done using `yt` utilizes the matplotlib library for actual deposition of pixels into an image format, although all of the *input* to that deposition is conducted by `yt`.
Making this distinction is important, because it underscores the relationship between the different libraries and how they exist in the ecosystem of scientific software; `yt` does not replace matplotlib, but rather, augments it by providing a grammar of analysis of volumetric data and defining how that grammar is translated into visual representations as presented by matplotlib.
