## Project Governance {#sec:governance}

Between the publication of the first paper and this paper, the `yt` project instituted a form of governance involving a steering committee, a set of "members" of the project, and a defined process for developing improvements and enhancements (the YTEP, or `yt`-enhancement-proposal process).
YTEPs are discussed in @sec:ytep.
The systems developed account for a number of important procedures, mostly related to decision-making, but do not address pressing community needs such as community standards for conduct, changes in committee composition, sub-project coordination, or the transition of members and developers to "emeritus" status.

This governance structure, however, serves as a process for the `yt` *project*, rather than just the software itself.
Much like other software projects with community-building as core goals, the `yt` project encompasses the core package itself (largely the subject of this paper), affiliated software projects (such as @doi:10.21105/joss.01774 ) but also, crucially, the broader community and the spaces in which discussions, tutorials, inquiries and development take place.
