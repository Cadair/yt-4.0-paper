## Development Procedure {#sec:development}

`yt` is developed openly.  During the Spring of 2017, development transitioned from occuring on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/) to [GitHub](https://github.com/yt-project/), and the source code management system was changed from [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) to [git](https://git-scm.org/).


### Answer Testing



### Code Review

### YTEP Process {#sec:ytep}

YTEPs, or "`yt`-enhancement proposal" are vehicles for collaborative decision-making in the project.
Implemented shortly after the first paper on `yt` was released, the YTEP process experienced a fairly pronounced period of usage during the transition between versions 2.0 and 3.0 of `yt`, and has since been utilized considerably less.
During periods of rapid development, the needs of the community for stability have to be balanced against desires for change; the YTEP process was implemented to facilitate stakeholder feedback, allow for discussion of design decisions, and to prompt detailed thinking about how and why things should be implemented.
We have modeled this process against that used in the AstroPy community ("APE").
To create a new proposal for a large change to `yt`, or to document a decision-making process, individuals prepare a description of the background, motivation for the change, the steps to implementation, and potential alternative approaches.
The proposal is discussed through the pull-request process, and once discussion has concluded it is added to the [repository](https://github.com/yt-project/ytep) of YTEPs that is auto-built and [deployed](https://ytep.readthedocs.org/).
The accepted YTEPs have included implementing the chunking system, developing a units system, removing legacy components, and implementing a code of conduct.

Below, we include a table of current YTEPs as of this writing.
