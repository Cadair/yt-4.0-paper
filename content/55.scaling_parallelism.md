## Scaling and Parallelism 

To support cases where data volume results in long processing time or large memory requirements, yt operations have been parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI; @mpi40).
When designing the parallel interface for yt, as discussed in [@doi:10.1088/0067-0049/192/1/9], the design goals included ensuring that scripts required little to no adjustments to be run in parallel.
In the intervening time, the parallel operation infrastructure has been rewritten in several key ways to enable individuals to apply multi-level parallelism to their analysis operations.

### Structure of Parallel Operations

Almost all of the operations in yt that are conducted in parallel follow a straightforward method of decomposing work and consolidating results:

 1. Identify which chunking method (see @sec:chunking) is most appropriate for the operation.
 2. Consolidate chunks according to IO minimization and assign to individual MPI tasks
 3. Join (potentially applying reduction operations) final results to provide solution to *all tasks* in the group

The final step, of joining across tasks, results in the final set of values being accessible to all tasks; this is not a universal "final step" in parallel operations, and in some cases results in substantial duplication of memory.
This compromise was accepted as a result of the design goals of ensuring that scripts can run unmodified.

The parallelism in yt heavily leans upon the "index" for a dataset either being available *already* at initiation time on all tasks, or that index being *accessible* through IO operations or fast generation.
This provides a degree of load-balancing that can be conducted, as estimates of memory and processing requirements are available on all tasks (and thus the load-balancing calculations are deterministic across all tasks).
In essence, this means that for grid-based datasets, the entire grid hierarchy is available on all processors; for octrees or particle datasets, it means that at least a rough estimate of the distribution of values must be available (and identical) on all processors.
This doesn't prevent opaquely distributed datasets from being decomposed, but it does allow datasets whose distribution is well-described to be decomposed with greater precision.
