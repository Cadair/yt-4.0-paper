## Extensions and Ecosystem

### Trident

Trident [@doi:10.3847/1538-4357/aa7e2d] is a Python-based open-source tool for
post-processing hydrodynamical simulations to produce synthetic absorption
spectra and related data.  In many ways, Trident is the first external package
that utilizes `yt` to provide data access and numerical operations, but then
builds on those to develop detailed, astrophysically-aware systems for
processing and analyzing that data.

### ytree

Building on `yt` for access to halo catalogs, and implementing a similar system
for derived fields as applied to graph datasets, ytree
[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.1174374] is a system for analyzing merger trees from
analysis of dark matter halos in cosmological simulations.

ytree provides flexibility in determining the path that a given analysis takes
through the graph of merger trees; for instance, it enables the user to select
if they wish to follow the "most massive" progenitor halo backwards in time, or
even to set their own criteria for this.  Connecting this to the raw,
unprocessed data from the simulation (such as the unsampled particle or cell
content that comprises the halos) allows researchers to deepen and guide their
analysis based on the physical characteristics of the merger history.
