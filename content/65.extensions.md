## Extensions and Ecosystem

### Trident

Trident [@doi:10.3847/1538-4357/aa7e2d] is a Python-based open-source tool for
post-processing hydrodynamical simulations to produce synthetic absorption
spectra and related data.  In many ways, Trident is the first external package
that utilizes `yt` to provide data access and numerical operations, but then
builds on those to develop detailed, astrophysically-aware systems for
processing and analyzing that data.
